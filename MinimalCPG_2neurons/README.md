# Chapter 5 ‚Äì Emergence of Sequential Dynamical Invariants in Central Pattern Generators from Auto-organized Constraints in their Sequence Time Intervals

This folder contains the source code and necessary files to reproduce the main simulations and results described in Chapter 5 of my thesis.

## üß† Overview

This simulation is based on the Komendantov-Kononenko model for a network of two chemical inhibitory neurons. In this chapter, the largest numer of simulations were carried out, with different parameters and ranges for each parameter explored. 

All simulations were conducted in both symmetric (fast and slow) and asymmetric configurations. It should be noted that although the focus is on a single code, all the combinations presented in the chapter are possible and easily adaptable from the same code. 

The differential equations are integrated using an adapted **6th-order Runge-Kutta method**, and **Lyapunov exponents** are computed to assess the stability of the dynamics.

## üìÅ Folder contents

- `script_komendantov.sh`: Main execution script. It compiles and runs the simulation.
- `initial_parameters`: Initial conditions file.
- `komendantov_X_f-Y_s_lyap_corr.c`: C source code for the model.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run the code

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., `gcc`) and execution permissions.
2. Give execute permission to the script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script_komendantov.sh
3. Run the script:
   ./script_komendantov.sh

The script compiles the code, reads initial conditions from condiciones_iniciales.txt, and produces output files containing the system's time evolution and Lyapunov exponents.

## üìä Analysis and plotting

The output files can be analyzed using the Python scripts in analisis_python/. For example:

python3 analisis_python/plot_dynamics.py resultados_ejemplo/variables.txt

## üìé Notes

This simulation focuses on the emergence of sequential invariants and dynamic constraints.

Initial conditions and parameters can be adjusted directly in the input files or code.
