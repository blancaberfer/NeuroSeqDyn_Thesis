# Chapter 7 ‚Äì Effect of Electrical Synapses in the Cycle-by-cycle Sequential Dynamics of a Pyloric Central Pattern Generator Model

This directory includes all the code and tools used in Chapter 7 of my thesis, focusing on the impact of electrical coupling in a pyloric CPG model.

## üß† Overview

This simulation models a **pyloric central pattern generator** (typically involving 5 or more neurons), based on the Komendantov-Kononenko equations and using a **6th-order Runge-Kutta** method for integration.

It explores the role of electrical synapses in shaping cycle-by-cycle dynamics of neural sequences.

## üìé Notes

    This version of the model includes electrical (gap junction) connections.

    Suitable for analyzing the impact of coupling strength and structure on timing and phase relations in the CPG.
