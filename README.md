# Sequential Neural Dynamics - Computational Neuroscience

This repository comprises all the code and supplementary materials utilised in the present PhD thesis (entitled: "Computational Models for Studying the Coordination of Sequential Bursting Neural Activity") on sequential dynamics in computational neuroscience. It encompasses simulations, data analysis scripts, and models pertaining to the Komendantov-Kononenko model and the pyloric CPG. Moreover, it provides links to experimental videos and supplementary materials referenced in the thesis.

The repository is structured as follows:
